Node.js CoffeeScript server
===========================
requires coffeescript and node.js (see below)

run by issuing:
    coffee -w server.coffee
    
This will convert to javascript internally, run the server, and watch the server.coffee file for modifications.


Installation hints
==================
The coffee translator is a node.js package, so you'll need to install a recent version from http://nodejs.org/#download
and then the npm package manager from http://npmjs.org/
and then install coffee http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/
