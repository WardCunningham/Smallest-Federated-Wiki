This will convert to javascript internally, run the server, and watch the server.coffee file for modifications.

==================
The coffee translator is a node.js package, so you'll need to install a recent version from http://nodejs.org/#download
and then the npm package manager from http://npmjs.org/
and then install coffee http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/
