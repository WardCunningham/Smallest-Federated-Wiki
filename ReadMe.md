Smallest Federated Wiki Goals
=============================

The original wiki was written in a week and cloned within a week after that.
The concept was shown to be fruitful while leaving other implementors room to innovate.
When we ask for simple, we are looking for the same kind of simplicity: nothing to distract from our innovation in federation.

We imagine two components:

1. a server component managing page storage and collaboration between peer servers, and,
2. a client component presenting and modifying the server state in server specific ways.

This project should be judged by the degree that it can:

* Demonstrate that wiki would have been better had it been effectively federated from the beginning.
* Explore federation policies necessary to sustain an open creative community.

This project has been founded within the community assembled in Portland at the Indie Web Camp:

Looking For Code Bloat
